INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING AND RUNNING Meth0d

REQUIREMENTS:
Node.js must be installed on your computer.
Download here: https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version recommended).

OPTION A: NATIVE INSTALLATION (Recommended)
This will create a real program file (.exe for Windows, etc.)

1.  Run "removetxt.bat".
2.  Run "generate_system_exe.bat".
    - This process takes time. It builds the app.
3.  When finished, open the "Install_files" folder.
4.  Run the installer file for your system (e.g., "Meth0d Setup 2.1.0.exe").
5.  Meth0d is now installed like a regular program!

OPTION B: LOCAL WEB SERVER (Quick Start)
If you just want to run it without installing:

1.  Run "removetxt.bat".
2.  Run "setup_app.bat".
3.  Run "run_meth0d.bat".
    - Keep the black window open.
    - Browser opens automatically.

DATA BACKUP
To save your data:
1.  Go to "Archive" in the app.
2.  Click "Download Backup" to get a .json file.
3.  Use "Import Backup" to restore data on any device.
