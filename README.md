# Meth0d v3.0

> **"Mutatus, iterum resurgo melior"** (Changed, I rise again improved)

**Meth0d** is a high-performance systemic analysis framework packaged as a Progressive Web App (PWA). It is designed to transform complex challenges into structured strategies using a rigorous 4-phase protocol.

## 🌀 Philosophy: The Qualitative Leap

Meth0d is built on the concept of **systemic evolution**. We don't just solve problems; we identify the underlying drivers and conflicts that sustain them. By resolving these fundamental tensions, we elevate the system to a new state of efficiency.

## ⚙️ Core Protocol

1.  **Phase 1: Multi-Vector Analysis**
    *   **Temporal:** Understanding the dynamics of evolution.
    *   **Interests:** Mapping stakeholder goals and resource control.
    *   **Structural:** Identifying critical system interdependencies.
    *   **Narrative:** Distinguishing public image from objective reality.

2.  **Phase 2: Tension Point Synthesis**
    *   Isolating the core contradiction driving the current state.

3.  **Phase 3: Strategic Vectors**
    *   Identifying leverage points, system vulnerabilities, and growth opportunities.

4.  **Phase 4: Robustness Audit**
    *   Critical self-evaluation, risk management, and blind-spot detection.

## 🛠 Features

*   **PWA Ready:** Installable on Desktop and Mobile. Works offline.
*   **Privacy First:** Local-first architecture. Your data never leaves your device.
*   **Multi-Thematic:** 8 professional themes from "Corporate" to "Cyberpunk".
*   **Tactical Execution:** Built-in checklist and praxis logs for project monitoring.
*   **Inter-object Linking:** Connect related analyses to map entire ecosystems of problems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Simply open the application. If it's your first launch, the **Strategic Orientation** tutorial will guide you through the systemic thinking process.
