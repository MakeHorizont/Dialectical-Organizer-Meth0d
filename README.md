**Meth0d** is a specialized Progressive Web Application (PWA) for dialectical materialist analysis. It transforms chaotic reality into structured strategy through a rigorous 4-phase protocol. It is not just a to-do list — it is a weapon for the mind.

## 🌀 Philosophy: The Logarithmic Spiral

The application is built on the concept of the **qualitative leap**. In dialectics, development proceeds in a spiral, not a circle. Each turn of the spiral seems to repeat the past, but on a higher, more complex level.

> *"Changed, I rise again improved."*

We do not simply solve problems; we "sublate" (Aufheben) them—resolving the contradiction to elevate the system to a new state of being.

## ☭ Core Features

*   **The Protocol:** A guided wizard that takes you through the 4 phases of analysis:
    1.  **Decomposition (Vectors):** Historical, Class, Systemic, and Ideological analysis.
    2.  **Synthesis:** Identifying the central contradiction driving the phenomenon.
    3.  **Strategy:** Identifying system vulnerabilities and opportunities for action.
    4.  **Audit:** Self-criticism and risk assessment.
*   **Semantic Theming:** Adapts to your mindset. Includes "Socialist" (Red), "Neutral" (Corporate/Structure), "Brutal" (High Contrast), and more.
*   **Offline First:** Built as a PWA with local encryption. Your data never leaves your device unless you share it.
*   **Education:** Built-in interactive tutorial explaining the foundations of Dialectical and Historical Materialism.

### Web / PWA (Development)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Desktop (Windows/Mac) - Quick Start

We provide batch scripts for quick local deployment without needing Electron immediately:

1.  Run `removetxt.bat` to prepare the scripts.
2.  Run `setup_app.bat` to build the application.
3.  Run `run_meth0d.bat` to launch the local server.

### Desktop (Electron)

To build a native executable (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`):

```bash
# Build for your current OS
npm run electron:build
```

The output will be in the `release` folder.

## 📚 Methodology

The application is structured around Lenin's "Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism":

1.  **Philosophy (Foundation):** Dialectical Materialism.
2.  **Political Economy (Walls):** Analysis of resources and interests.
3.  **Scientific Communism (Goal):** Strategic action and revolutionary practice.
